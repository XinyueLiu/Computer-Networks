# Computer-Networks

2017 Summer

This respository includes all the course project of Computer-Networks.


Lab1 - implement BellmanFord algorithm:
       
  print out the shortest paths from node 0 to all the other nodes.
       
  if there exist negative loops. output any one of the negative loops.
<br />  
       
Lab2 - Wishark DHCP & ARP Lab

  PARTI:  examine the DHCP packets captured by a host using Wireshark. 
       
  PARTII: observe ARP protocol in action by looking up ARP cache.
<br />      
     
     
Lab3 - Ethernet network Lab

  Demonstrate the operation of the Ethernet network 
       
  Examine the performance of the Ethernet network under different scenarios
       


Final Project - UNIX socket programming using both TCP and UDP connections.

  The project has 2 major phases: 
      
   1) Three tweet person opens its input file (TweetA.txt, TweetB.txt or TweetC.txt) and opens a TCP connection with the server to send tweets.

   2) The server sends twitters to followers through UDP, 
      the followers feedback their “like” to server through TCP and then the server informs the tweeting people who like their tweets also through TCP.
